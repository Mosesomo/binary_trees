Binary Trees
----------------------------------------------------

A binary tree is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming. It's a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are commonly used for a wide range of applications, including representing hierarchical data structures, sorting and searching algorithms, and more.
